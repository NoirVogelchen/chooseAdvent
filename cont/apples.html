<p> You decide to buy apples.  You eat one as you are shopping.  A few customers give
you funny looks, but dont say anything.  You find everything else you are looking fore
and pay before leaving.  You fly home.  On the way, you eat more apples.  By the time
you get home, all of them are gone.  You realize you'll have to go out again tomorrow.</p>

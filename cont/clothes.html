<p> You decide to go clothes shopping.  Inside there are a mess of choices.
You move up and down the isles trying to find something that'll peak your interset.
I took a few hours of browsing, but you eventually narow it down to two things.
The first being a bright orange poncho, the second being a yellow rain coat.</p>
<br>
<p>Which one will you buy?</p>
